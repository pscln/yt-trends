# YT-Trends
Analysis of German YouTube trends (trending videos) of December 2019 to 2020

## About this project
Since December of 2019, an application sends a request to the YouTube api requesting the 50 videos of the youtube 'trends' every hour. For each video, the application stores some metadata in a database. That data contains the current amount of likes, dislikes, views or trend rating but also the current title, video description and tags. I created this hobby project to train myself in the statistic language R and concepts of data science.

Please note that my data can be incomplete or corrupted due to server downtimes or errors.
For legal reasons, I cannot publish the records of the database.
